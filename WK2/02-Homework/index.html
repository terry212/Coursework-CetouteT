                    My name is Terry Cetoute. I am a computer nerd who has always been fascinated by computers and how
                    they work and operate. My love and passion for computers led me to pursue an undergraduate degree in
                    Mechatronics Engineering. Mechatronics is an engineering discipline which is fused with mechanical,
                    electrical,
                    and computer engineering.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    It all began in the space of Information Technology. I taught myself Photoshop in High School and
                    still utilize that skill today through the creation of flyers, logos, and other requests made by
                    clients.
                    In college, I was privileged to join the Robotics club. There I learned several languages such as
                    C++
                    and Java. With these skills and my teammates, we were able to win the VEX U Robotics Championship. I
                    learned
                    how to write programs and each year, I would reuse the previous code and refactor the code to be
                    "smarter"
                    and more fluid.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I strayed away to another type of programming which is found in the field of automation. I worked
                    for Toyota for three years, programming heavy machinery and complex devices. I finally moved on to
                    another company where I have afforded the opportunity to join the Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech.
